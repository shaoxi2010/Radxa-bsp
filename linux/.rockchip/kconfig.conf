# The following config has security complecations:

# However, this is required for the following issues:
# * RK356X MPP hardware video acceleration was not working
# * RK3399 Xorg "screen not found" error
# The root issue is that DRM driver requires exclusive access to the graphical card.
# However, both Mali and MPP also requires GPU access.
# Rockchip provides 3 workarounds for this:
# * Ignore exclusive access <= this config
# * Remove exclusive access from Mali
# * Remove exclusive access from libdrm
